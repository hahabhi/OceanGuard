# OceanGuard 🌊

**A comprehensive ocean hazard monitoring and citizen reporting platform for INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services)**

## 🚨 Problem Statement

India's vast coastline spanning over 7,500 kilometers is highly vulnerable to ocean hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, coastal flooding, and abnormal tidal behavior. While agencies like INCOIS provide early warnings based on satellite data and numerical models, several critical gaps exist:

- **Limited Real-time Field Data**: Ground reality information from affected areas is often unavailable or delayed
- **Untapped Citizen Observations**: Local communities and coastal residents have valuable firsthand knowledge that remains unutilized
- **Social Media Intelligence Gap**: Critical discussions and eyewitness reports on social platforms during disasters are not systematically monitored
- **Communication Breakdown**: During emergencies, traditional communication channels often fail, leaving remote coastal areas isolated
- **Language Barriers**: Warning systems primarily operate in English, limiting accessibility for regional language speakers
- **No Unified Platform**: Fragmented reporting mechanisms make it difficult to aggregate and validate real-time hazard information

## 💡 Our Solution

OceanGuard bridges the gap between official early warning systems and ground reality by creating a **unified citizen-powered disaster monitoring ecosystem**. Our platform transforms ordinary citizens into a distributed sensor network while providing emergency agencies with real-time, validated intelligence.

### Key Solution Components:
- **Crowdsourced Reporting**: Enable anyone to report ocean hazards with geotagged photos/videos
- **AI-Powered Validation**: Automatic hazard classification and confidence scoring using advanced NLP
- **Multi-Source Intelligence**: Integrate citizen reports, social media feeds, and official bulletins
- **Emergency Response Tools**: One-click SOS reporting and mesh network communication for network outages
- **Real-time Decision Support**: Live admin dashboard for emergency agencies with validation workflows

## 🔄 Solution Workflow (How It Works)

### 1. **Citizen Observation & Reporting**
- A coastal resident notices unusual wave behavior or flooding
- Opens OceanGuard app and taps "Report Hazard"
- Automatically captures GPS location and uploads photos/videos
- Describes the situation in their local language (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
- Report is instantly submitted to the system

### 2. **Intelligent Processing & Classification**
- AI/ML pipeline analyzes the text description and classifies hazard type
- Image verification system examines uploaded media for authenticity
- System calculates confidence score based on multiple factors:
  - Source credibility (citizen, official, social media)
  - Text analysis and keyword matching
  - Media verification results
  - Historical data correlation

### 3. **Multi-Source Data Fusion**
- Similar reports from the same area are automatically clustered
- Social media feeds are monitored for related discussions
- INCOIS/IMD official warnings are cross-referenced
- Confidence scores are dynamically adjusted as more data arrives

### 4. **Real-time Admin Validation**
- Emergency response teams see pending reports in validation queue
- Each report shows confidence score, location, media evidence
- Admins can approve, reject, or request more information
- Approved events boost confidence; rejected ones reduce it

### 5. **Emergency Broadcasting & Response**
- Validated high-priority events trigger real-time alerts
- Citizens receive location-based notifications
- Emergency services get actionable intelligence
- Interactive map shows live hazard hotspots and affected areas

### 6. **Offline Emergency Communication**
- In network outage scenarios, reports can "hop" between phones via Bluetooth
- Mesh network ensures critical information reaches connected devices
- Automatic submission when internet connectivity is restored
